# Privacy Health Monitor - Video Dialogue

## Section 1: Opening & Problem Statement

Healthcare data breaches expose millions of sensitive patient records every year. What if we could monitor public health trends without compromising individual privacy?

---

## Section 2: Solution Overview

Introducing Privacy Health Monitor, a blockchain application built with FHEVM that uses fully homomorphic encryption. Patients submit their vital signs, and the data remains encrypted on-chain throughout its entire lifecycle.

---

## Section 3: Live Demo - Patient Submission

Watch as a patient connects their wallet and submits health data. Heart rate, blood pressure, glucose levels, and temperature are all encrypted before being stored on the blockchain. The patient's privacy is guaranteed because their individual data is never visible in plaintext.

---

## Section 4: Doctor Dashboard & Aggregation

Doctors can generate aggregated statistics without ever seeing individual patient records. The smart contract performs computations directly on encrypted data using FHE technology. Here, we see average vital signs calculated from five patients, giving doctors population insights while preserving individual privacy.

## Section 5: Key Features & Call to Action

Privacy Health Monitor demonstrates the power of FHEVM with full encryption, healthcare compliance readiness, and real-time health alerts. This project is open source and includes comprehensive tests, documentation, and deployment scripts. Visit the GitHub repository to explore the code and learn how FHE can transform confidential computing in healthcare.
